# 🌸 Clustering Analysis: Iris Dataset

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques—specifically **clustering algorithms**—to the famous **Iris dataset** to discover natural groupings in the data without using labels.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The **Iris dataset** contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each sample has 4 features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

---

## 📌 Objective

Perform **clustering analysis** to:
- Explore the natural grouping of data points using algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
- Visualize clusters and compare them with the actual species.
- Evaluate clustering performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for clustering and evaluation)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development)
